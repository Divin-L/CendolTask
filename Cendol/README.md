Hello here am explaining about the task
-> here im trying to accomplish 3 task in single output
-> first in component A am having variable cendol with value 2 ,am passing it to the component B through props
-> in component B am using state btn to store the true false value ,and using handleClick function to change the ture false value on clicking the button
->depending upon the btn state (true or false ) color going to change in between the counter division and button
-> by spreading props am getting data which i have passed in component A ,am assigning it to the state count as default value ,in handleClick function using setCount am incrementing count by 10
